# iQvoc

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/innoq/iqvoc.png)](http://travis-ci.org/innoq/iqvoc)

iQvoc is a vocabulary management tool that combines easy-to-use human interfaces with Semantic Web interoperability.

iQvoc supports vocabularies that are common to many knowledge organization systems, such as:

* Thesauri
* Taxonomies
* Classification schemes
* Subject heading systems

iQvoc provides comprehensive functionality for all aspects of managing such vocabularies:

* import of existing vocabularies from a SKOS representation
* multilingual display and navigation in any Web browser
* editorial features for registered users
* publishing the vocabulary in the Semantic Web

iQvoc is built with state-of-the-art technology and can be easily customized according to user's needs.

## Setup

### Heroku

You can easily setup your iQvoc instance in under 5 minutes, we wanted to make this process really easy.

To run iQvoc on heroku do the following:

```
bundle install
bundle exec heroku create --stack bamboo
bundle exec rake heroku:config
git push heroku master
bundle exec heroku rake db:migrate
bundle exec heroku rake db:seed
bundle exec heroku restart
```

`heroku open` opens your app in the browser.

Remember to visit the Users section and change the default passwords!

**Remarks:**
For now iQvoc only supports the standard Bamboo stack. Cedar is not supported as we have `sqlite3` as a dependency
in the Gemfile and Cedar does not support a custom `BUNDLE_WITHOUT` config like Bamboo at the moment.

### Custom

We recommend running [iQvoc as a Rails engine](https://github.com/innoq/iqvoc/wiki/iQvoc-as-a-Rails-Engine).
Running the cloned source code is possible but any modifications would require a fork.

1. Configure your database via `config/database.template.yml`. Don't forget to rename it to `database.yml`
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec rake db:create` to create the database
4. Create the necessary tables by running `rake db:migrate`
5. Load some base data by running `rake db:seed`
6. Run `bundle exec rake setup:generate_secret_token`
7. Boot up the app using `bundle exec rails s` (or `passenger start` if you use passenger)
8. Log in with "admin@iqvoc" / "admin" or "demo@iqvoc" / "cooluri" (cf. step #5)
9. Visit the Users section and change the default passwords

## Compatibility

iQvoc is fully compatible with Ruby 1.9.2, 1.8.7 and JRuby 1.6.

## Customization

There are many hooks providing support for your own classes and configuration. The core app
also works as a Rails Engine. The config residing in `lib/iqvoc.rb` provides a basic
overview of the possibilities.

## Documentation
